# Agentic-loop playground

A local web page that runs the production chat agent (`pipeline.retrieval.agent`)
in-process against a real index, with the knobs that matter for retrieval quality
taken from a JSON config you edit and save in the browser. Every turn is recorded.

```sh
uv run --with pymupdf==1.28.2 python bench/rag/playground/scripts/playground.py --target lab
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Set `ALIBABA_API_KEY` in the shell first if a config uses `capture.mode = "ocr"`, and
`TENCENT_API_KEY` for configs whose model transport points at Tencent TokenHub.

## Targets

| Target | Index | How it is reached |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lab` | Frozen September 9 evaluation database (`odl_eval`): 29 sources, workspaces `odl_eval_odl` (refined ODL with generated captions), `odl_eval_mineru`, `odl_eval_odl_nocaption` (same refined ODL chunks, no caption step; added 2026-09-12 by `odl_agentic_prepare.py nocaption` then `index --arms odl_nocaption`) and `odl_eval_odl_ocr` (the caption-free chunks plus RapidOCR lines on the eleven pages with no text layer, staged by `bench/parsers/scripts/experiment_odl_selective_ocr.py`, then `index --arms odl_ocr`) | ssh tunnel to the ingest host, loopback port 55435 |
| `uat` | The UAT Postgres (currently five workspaces, one file, no chunks) | ssh tunnel through the ingest host to the WireGuard address 10.77.0.3 |

The server opens the tunnel itself (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519_capy_ingest`), reads the
UAT worker's provider and bucket credentials over ssh into process memory, and
points `DATABASE_URL` at the chosen target. Provider spend lands on the UAT keys.
One server process serves one target; run two on different ports for both.

Lab source PDFs come from `bench/rag/fixtures/local/2026-09-09-odl-agentic/pdfs`.
UAT PDFs are downloaded from the UAT bucket on first capture into `local/pdfs/uat`
(Office sources use their LibreOffice preview PDF, the coordinate space the chunk
regions refer to).

The lab dump predates the trash columns; `ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN trashed_at
timestamptz` was applied to the live lab database on 2026-09-12 so the current
store queries run. The frozen dump file is unchanged.

## What the playground writes

Nothing in either database. The `rag_search_events` telemetry write is disabled
for the turn. Runs land in `local/runs/<id>/run.json` with the effective config,
the exact system prompt, every tool call with the text the model saw, every
provider call with token counts, captured images, citations and the answer.
`local/` is git-ignored; `configs/` is committed so config changes are reviewable.

## Config

Fields absent from a config take the defaults in `DEFAULT_CONFIG`
(`scripts/playground.py`). The interesting ones:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `model` | A `model_configs` pin (`provider_slug`, `model_slug`, `version`, `thinking`). Add `adhoc: {…}` to pin a model the catalog lacks; the provider's platform key must exist |
| `model.transport` | Send this pin to another OpenAI-compatible endpoint: `{"url", "key_env", "wire_model", "body"}`. `body` picks the request builder (`zai`, `openai`, `deepseek`). Used to serve GLM-5.3-flash from Tencent TokenHub (`https://tokenhub-intl.tencentcloudmaas.com/v1/chat/completions`) instead of the production DeepInfra route |
| `answer.citations` | `as_is` (production numbering), `renumber` (markers rewritten to 1, 2, … in first-appearance order while streaming; the final list holds only the passages used) or `structured` (the answer is JSON: claims with the passages that ground each; the playground writes the prose and numbers) |
| `system_prompt` / `prompt_addon` | `null` keeps the production prompt; a string replaces it. The addon is appended either way |
| `tools` | Subset of `search_workspace`, `list_sources`, `describe_documents`, `read_document`, `capture_page` |
| `limits` | `planning_responses`, `tools_per_response`, `tools_per_turn`, `captures_per_turn` |
| `search` | `top_k`, `per_file_cap` |
| `capture.mode` | `pixels` attaches the JPEG to the conversation (needs a vision chat model); `ocr` sends it to Qwen3.5-OCR (`ocr_route` `docparse` or `chat`) and returns the transcript as a passage; `caption` asks the captioning model, question-aware when `question_aware` is true |
| `capture.require_seen_page` | Refuse captures of pages no retrieved passage has shown |
| `capture.citation` | `page` (default): a capture of a page that retrieved passages already cite adds no citation; the tool result names their numbers and the model cites those. `new`: every capture is its own citation with the rendered box as region |
| `capture.max_edge`, `capture.detail` | The density knobs. GLM, DeepSeek and Qwen price an image by the pixels sent (GLM: about width × height / 784 tokens, a 28-pixel patch grid), so the long edge and the model's `bbox` decide the cost; `detail` (`low`, `high`, `auto`) is passed through only for OpenAI, the one provider with a switch |
| `context.input_limit_tokens` | Force the agent's compaction threshold down (production uses the model's usable input limit, 250k at most) to exercise checkpoint folds and live compaction on short conversations; the summarizer's own fit check keeps the real limit |
| `quality.show` | Append `[extraction confidence …]` to passage headers from `local/quality/<target>-<workspace>.json`; `only_below` hides notes above a score |

`capture_page(file_id, page, bbox?)` renders the page or a box on the 0-1000
page grid (top-left origin, the same space as chunk `regions`). In `pixels` mode
the image rides in a user message placed after the tool results of that step,
because chat-completions tool messages carry text only. Captures get a citation
with the rendered box as its region.

## Citation modes

Production assigns a number to every passage when a tool result comes back and
the model cites by those numbers, so an answer can read `[1][6]`. `renumber`
rewrites markers as they stream (a marker cut at a chunk boundary is held back
until it closes) and emits a final `citations` event with `final: true`, the
passages the answer used in their new order, and the retrieved-but-unused ones
under `unused`. `structured` adds a rule to the system prompt asking for
`{"answer": [{"text", "passages"}]}`, enforces `response_format: json_object`
only on calls that offer no tools (with tools offered, GLM under `json_object`
skipped the search and invented an answer), makes one repair call when the
answer does not parse, and renders the prose itself. `run.json` keeps the raw
model text as `answer_raw` and any repair output as `repair_raw`.

## Context, compaction and checkpoints

Every model call emits a `context` line: the provider-reported input tokens
(and cached reads), the production estimator's total against the limit the
compactor enforces, and a breakdown by part: system prompt, tool schemas,
memory (folded checkpoint), prior history, the query, this turn's assistant
steps, tool results (with their count) and attached images (count and patch
estimate). The estimator runs above the provider count by roughly a third on
these runs; both numbers are recorded per call in `run.json`.

Conversation turns carry message ids, so the agent's rolling checkpoint works
as in production: when the request would not fit, completed history is folded
into a memory message, a `checkpoint` event names the last folded message, and
the page drops those messages from the history it sends next time and passes
the checkpoint payload instead (what the Go gateway does). Live compaction
inside a turn folds the same way. Each summarizer call is shown as a
`compaction` card with the folded count, the memory size and the text, and is
kept under `compactions` in the run. Seen while testing: on a two-message
history the memory came back longer than the history it replaced (295 to 410
tokens for about 360), so a very small forced limit ends in
`context_too_large`; the summarizer prompt targets 4k to 10k tokens and is
built for long histories.

## Extraction confidence

`chunk_quality.py` scores every chunk of one workspace offline, parser-agnostic:

```sh
uv run --with pymupdf==1.28.2 python bench/rag/playground/scripts/chunk_quality.py --target lab --workspace odl_eval_odl
```

Per chunk it measures how much of the chunk's text the cited pages' text layer
contains (words for spaced scripts, characters for CJK), whether those pages have
a text layer at all, whether pipe-table rows have consistent column counts, and
how much of each page's text layer the index carries at all. Generated captions
score at most 0.5. It reads the source PDF and the chunks; it changes no rows.
Limits: it cannot see reading-order or cell-association errors when every word is
present, and an OCR text layer counts as a text layer.

## Checks

```sh
uv run --with pymupdf==1.28.2 python bench/rag/playground/scripts/capture.py
uv run python bench/rag/playground/scripts/chunk_quality.py --check
uv run python bench/rag/playground/scripts/playground.py --check
```
